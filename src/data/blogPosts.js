Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella predicts these agents will disrupt traditional SaaS models, heralding a \"post-app\" era [12].\nEthical AI and Global Regulation: The EU AI Act set a precedent in 2024, banning high-risk applications like social scoring while mandating transparency for chatbots [7,12]. In 2025, expect tighter controls on data sourcing and synthetic content, driven by lawsuits like The New York Times v. OpenAI [7].\nEnergy Efficiency vs. AI's Hunger: AI's energy consumption is unsustainableâ€”training GPT-4o reportedly consumed as much power as 1,000 households annually. Innovations like NVIDIA's Rubin chips and leaner models (e.g., GPT-4o Mini) aim to curb this, but the race is far from won [9,10].\nHuman-AI Collaboration Redefined: Tools like Co:Driver (Peak) will bridge predictive and generative AI, empowering users to interrogate AI decisions in real time [6]. The line between human and machine creativity will blur further, as seen in MusicFX DJ's collaboration with Jacob Collier [1]."
